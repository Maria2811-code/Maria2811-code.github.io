### About myself
#### My moto

*My job is to help change social norms.*
_So that people learn to take responsibility for their lives, rather than looking for blame and resenting injustice._
**My purpose is for situations like this,**
***when you need a cheerful ironic look from the outside, when you need to bring in some drive and air,***
to make it all come alive again and in a new way.
